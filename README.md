# Breakout_Prototype

NOTES: 
This project was made using Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1), and the Build of this project is located in BreakoutPrototype > Build > BreakoutPrototype.exe, and in BreakoutPrototype > BreakoutPrototype.exe. For this project, I made my own custom physics functionality for the first time! Overall, this project took me 14 - 15 hours to make. 

BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME: 

To play this game, you will need a keyboard and a mouse. You will play as a capsule controlling a ball. When you begin the game you will see a bar at the top of the screen. This bar keeps count of your score, and also contains a button with which you can RESTART the game. Additionally, whenever the ball goes outside the bounds of the game, it will automatically re-instantiate - this does not change your score. 

HOW TO PLAY: 

The shield's rotation can be changed by moving the cursor left and right across the screen - by changing the rotation, you can change the direction in which the ball travels. You can also change the movement of the character using the 'A' key to move the character left, and 'D' key to move the character right.

The ball also randomly changes colors, relative to the two squares on the screen. You earn a point when the ball hits a square of the same color, and you lose a point when the ball hits the square whose color does not match the color of the ball. The goal is to get the highest possible score!
